# Cybersecurity Professional Portfolio

## About Me

I am a dedicated cybersecurity professional with expertise in threat detection, incident response, and security architecture. With a background in both offensive and defensive security, I specialize in identifying vulnerabilities before they can be exploited and building robust security systems that protect critical infrastructure.

## Areas of Expertise

- **Threat Intelligence & Analysis**: Advanced threat hunting, malware analysis, and threat actor profiling
- **Network Security**: Deep packet inspection, traffic analysis, segmentation strategies, and secure architecture design
- **Cloud Security**: Securing multi-cloud environments with focus on AWS, Azure, and GCP
- **Application Security**: SAST/DAST implementation, secure code review, and DevSecOps integration
- **AI Security**: Protecting ML/AI systems from adversarial attacks and data poisoning
- **Incident Response**: Creating and implementing comprehensive incident response plans and leading IR teams

## Projects

### Security Automation Framework
A modular Python-based framework that automates common security tasks including vulnerability scanning, configuration auditing, and compliance reporting. Designed to integrate with existing security tools via APIs.

### Cloud Security Posture Manager
Custom tool to continuously monitor cloud environments for security misconfigurations, compliance violations, and unauthorized changes using infrastructure-as-code principles.

### Threat Intelligence Platform
Open-source intelligence gathering platform that collects, analyzes, and correlates threat data from multiple sources to provide actionable intelligence for security teams.

### Supply Chain Risk Assessment Tool
A methodology and supporting tools for analyzing software dependencies and third-party components for security risks in the development pipeline.
